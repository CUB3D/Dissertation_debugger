# CSC3032 - Major project in Computer Science
This is my dissertation project for my Computer Science Bsc, (warning: this code is a tad messy)

TL;DR: This is an X86_64 Linux debugger, based on the PTrace API, written in Rust, with a GUI via Dear Imgui.
Supports Breakpoints; viewing memory and register state; call stacks; `strace` style system call logging and works with mutiprocess-multithreadded binaries.
Also has some (incomplete) work on windows / macos / linux aarch64 debugging
